Note: For the app icons (logo192.png and logo512.png), you'll need to add them to your repository.

You can create simple placeholder icons with these dimensions (192x192 and 512x512 pixels) using any design tool, or you can use generic React or authorization-themed icons.

These files should be placed in the "public" folder of your project.
